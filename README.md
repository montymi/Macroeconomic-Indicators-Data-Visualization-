# Macroeconomic-Indicators-Data-Visualization
Project Description:
Over the course of this project, our aim is to develop and refine data visualization skills. 
Coming from diverse educational backgrounds, our team members have varying degrees of comfort with data science and analytics, 
so we determined that a good starting place would be a visualization project. 
This allows each individual to become accustomed to fundamental concepts like web scraping and data wrangling. 
The next step is finding the most efficient and clear ways to communicate our findings, based on the data, in a visual format. 
Our primary objective is to develop and cement some of the more foundational data science skills. 
However, beyond the project deadline, there is a lot of potential to really expand upon this project. 
Running basic supervised machine learning algorithms and determining which might be most appropriate given the dataset and our visualizations. 
 
Our primary motivation behind this particular project topic is to gain a high-level understanding of how geo-political events impact the global economy. 
We have decided to examine this through the lens of the European economy, 
as the unique political landscape contributes to a significant amount of overlap and interdependence between countries. 
We will look at statistics that reflect the production of each countryâ€™s economy to help us quantify any anomalies in the economic trends. 
Another thing we are considering, is which macroeconomic indicator -- or combinations of multiple indicators -- are best suited to reflect certain types of events.
Our plan of approach is to start with a handful of indicators and compare the changes in the visuals at specific periods of time. 
For example, a period of interest would be Brexit and the following few months. 
Through this process we will not only develop our technical capabilities, but also gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity of global economies.
